# A Systems Thinking Story

In this post I'll tell the story of an imaginary catchment community striving for a healthy environment. I will then draw on Donella Meadows' systems thinking framework to examine some of the dynamics of this situation and assess what approaches might be most effective for environmental restoration. The post represents a turning point for me - when I first seriously considered that systems thinking might become a rigorous focus of my professional work rather than just a side interest that I liked the idea of but didn't seriously pursue.

I wrote the original version hastily as part of my application to the Masters of Applied Cybernetics. It was my attempt to make sense of what I'd learned firsthand in my environmental career by putting it into Donella Meadows' leverage points framework. I'm not sure why it is, but my instinct is that fictional narratives are a great way of communicating complexity. I feel that this piece better communicates my grasp of systems thinking than an academic literature review would. 

When I asked Claude to help me edit for clarity, he tried to add a conclusion with specific recommendations for what the fictional community should do. I deleted that conclusion because the scenario in the story is a contested environmental problem. The surface-level system dynamics modelling I did may provide a persuasive argument for one side of the debate but I now know that I would need to know more about the situation before adopting a partisan stance in this contested complex situation. Participating in the Masters of Applied Cybernetics programme I did get to read-up about the specific systems thinking tools designed for these contested situations - tools I knew nothing about when I wrote this piece. Claude's edits spared you a fair bit of the original's technical jargon along with a few poorly structured sentences.

# Grevillea Creek Story

Grevillea Creek is a catchment of about 50,000 hectares. The average annual rainfall of 800mm is spread evenly throughout the year. The rocks underlying the catchment were mostly formed by a volcano about 100 million years ago. The volcanic-derived soils are relatively stable and fertile, and as such the catchment was settled early. The native forest was originally cleared by loggers and pastoralists have kept it clear ever since.

Clearing of the forest dramatically altered the hydrology of the Grevillea Creek catchment. Reduced infiltration and interception of rain on the slopes greatly increased the size and power of flows delivered to the creek. Erosion proceeded slowly due to the natural resistivity of the volcanic soils. But after nearly two centuries of colonial management, major issues are emerging.

More powerful flows from the deforested headwaters have caused extension of the meander bends throughout the floodplain reach of Grevillea Creek. In recent years, floods caused large slugs of sediment to wash down from the tributaries. The sediment slugs choked sections of the creek and, in one instance, caused it to bypass a meander bend. This straightened the stream and increased the velocity of its flows.

The values of the Grevillea Creek community have evolved over time. The pioneers valued self-sufficiency and saw themselves competing for a shrinking frontier. Longer-term environmental management first started in earnest during the 1950s when the state's soil conservation service sent experts to solve issues for individual landholders. Erosion in many of the headwater streams was temporarily stopped during the soil conservation era.

Following a crippling drought in the late 1980s, the community founded a Landcare group. Participation in the group waxed and waned over the years. At times, the group's efforts galvanised around a plan to address a specific issue. Most often these were driven by the availability of outside funding.

The Landcare group often discusses options for dealing with the increasing unpredictability of Grevillea Creek, especially as the changing course of the creek has begun to threaten houses and farm infrastructure. Two factions have emerged in the discussion. They have different ways of seeing the problem and very different proposals for solutions:

**The systematic thinkers**: One faction proposes a comprehensive engineered solution. They argue that what is needed for certain success is to treat all the actively eroding meander bends with rock groins (stone barriers that redirect water flow). They also propose preventing erosion in the tributaries by installing concrete flumes (artificial channels that carry water). This approach treats each erosion site as an isolated problem requiring a specific structural fix. Their approach is rigorous, certain to get results and aligned with best-practice engineering methods. They are uncomfortable with the other faction's ideas because the outcomes seem uncertain and it would be hard to hold anyone to account if it didn't work. 

**The systemic thinkers**: The second faction argues that the systematic thinkers are only treating symptoms rather than addressing root causes. They contend that the traditional engineering proposal would require an unrealistic upfront investment and expensive ongoing maintenance. Instead, they advocate fencing grazing animals out of the worst tributary gullies to allow natural revegetation. They also argue that the recent straightening of the creek caused it to cross a threshold into a new phase of rapid deterioration. They believe the former, more sinuous course of the creek must be restored through direct intervention. They also proposed significant efforts towards reforestation. The systemic faction argue that their proposal would address the fundamental drivers of the problem. They argue that restoring self-perpetuating natural functions is ultimately much cheaper to maintain than engineered structures.

## Systems Analysis Using Leverage Points

Systems analysts use the concept of leverage points to identify where to intervene in complex systems. Leverage points are variables that have strong impacts on the state of the wider system. In her influential paper *Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System*, Donella Meadows classifies twelve types of leverage points and gives an approximate hierarchy of their relative influence.

Of the twelve leverage points presented by Meadows, I'll examine four points evident in the Grevillea Creek story, arranged in increasing order of their potential impact on the system.

### Constants, Parameters, Numbers

These are the numerical values that determine how the system operates - subsidies, taxes, standards, or in this case, the number of erosion sites or amount of available funding.

The Grevillea Creek story contains many examples of parameters that could be altered. The systematic faction focuses heavily on this type of intervention. They want to reduce the number of headcuts (where water cuts back into the landscape, creating gullies) and the number of active meander bends through direct treatment with heavy machinery and quarry rock.

The amount of government funding available for restoration work is another crucial parameter that residents frequently discuss. Many bemoan that government funding has shrunk since the soil conservation era, consequently reducing action on an ever-increasing problem. However, according to Meadows' hierarchy, the amount of funding is among the weakest leverage points at play. A poorly structured socio-ecological system can exhaust large flows of annual funding without fundamentally changing its trajectory.

This suggests that the systematic faction's focus on securing more funding to treat more erosion sites individually may be less effective than they imagine.

### The Gain Around Positive Feedback Loops

Positive feedback loops are self-reinforcing cycles where effects amplify causes. The power of these loops can often be adjusted by changing the conditions that drive them.

Erosion is a classic positive feedback loop. Most soils have an erosion-resistant surface layer protecting more susceptible material below. As erosion proceeds, more erodible subsoils are exposed, accelerating further erosion. In catchments with highly erodible soil, erosion rates can peak just twenty years after settlement. Grevillea Creek's volcanic soils are more resistant, which is why erosion is still accelerating 150 years after settlement.

A crucial leverage point available to the community is excluding grazing animals from creek areas. Reduced grazing allows more vegetation to grow in the channel, slowing water flow and encouraging deposition of new sediment. New soil supports more vegetation growth, completing a positive feedback loop in the opposite direction - towards stability rather than erosion.

Removing cattle grazing increases the gain around this stabilising loop and can have dramatic effects on stream health. Some Grevillea Creek residents advocate this approach, recognising its power to harness natural processes rather than fighting against them.

### The Rules of the System

These are the incentives, punishments, and constraints that govern behaviour - both physical and social rules.

On the physical side, the structural geology of the valley creates important constraints. As meander bends widened in response to increased flow energy, some eventually reached the valley edges where they encountered impervious rock. The width of the valley limited the maximum sinuosity (bendiness) the channel could achieve, constraining its ability to dissipate flow energy naturally. Because of these geological rules, Grevillea Creek cannot evolve a stable geometry that effectively traps sediment and resists erosion. The systems restoration advocates propose temporarily rewriting these rules through strategic intervention.

On the social side, legislation creates powerful constraints. Early colonial policies may have incentivised or even mandated land clearing - governments sometimes seized land from owners who failed to clear it for agriculture. This made forest clearing virtually inevitable. On the other hand, environmental legislation ennacted mid 20th century banned landowners from cutting down trees. This prevented complete deforestation and resulted in a gradual recovery of some parts of the forest.

Modern legislation continues to govern what's possible for the community. Rules against intervention in "natural streams" can prevent communities from experimenting with restoration of degraded waterways. By preventing experimentation with these leverage points, legislative constraints can have unintended negative implications for environmental outcomes.

### The Mindset or Paradigm

This is the deepest level - the shared ideas and assumptions from which the system's goals, structure, rules, and parameters arise.

The paradigms of the Grevillea Creek community have evolved significantly over time. Early settlers possessed a frontier mindset that valued land clearing and saw nature as something to be conquered. Today's residents hold very different values, but they still operate within paradigms that shape their approach to environmental problems.

The systematic faction remains embedded in an atomistic paradigm - they believe complex problems can be solved by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces and addressing each individually. This mechanistic worldview sees the catchment as a collection of separate erosion sites requiring specific fixes.

The systems restoration advocates operate from a holistic paradigm. They see the whole as more than the sum of its parts and believe the most fundamental issues arise from disrupted relationships between system components. In their view, erosion is not the main problem - the main problem is the disruption of natural processes that maintained healthy sediment regimes before colonisation.

## Implications and Recommendations

True to Meadows' hierarchy, paradigms appear to be the strongest drivers in the Grevillea Creek catchment. The future trajectory depends less on funding availability or specific restoration techniques than on the prevailing worldview of the human inhabitants.

The most effective response to the problem faced by the community likely combines interventions at multiple leverage points, but prioritises the deeper, more influential levels. Rather than simply securing more funding for erosion control, the community might achieve better outcomes by changing how they think about their relationship with the landscape and developing new rules and institutions that support more effective collective action.
